    <h1>Basic document structure exercise</h1>
    <h4>HTML+01 exercise</h4>
    <p>My name is Carla van Greunen. <br>I live in South Africa, Western Cape.
    <br>
I am a mommy of two precious children. Never in my life did I think that coding would be this interesting and fun. <br>Something interesting about me is that I love to adapt with the world around me and embrace the changes of technology. I take on anything that I feel would make a difference in my life - that would make me understand how the world of tech is changing. <br><br>Thank you for creating this course and making it easy to understand.
